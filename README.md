# TrampDDCalc
Rudimentary DD Calculation app for Trampoline Based on FIG COP 2025-2028

Currently the on-screen buttons only work for entering a new skill; for editing previous skill entries you must use keyboard inputs.

I forgot to add a backspace on-screen button. later. probably

Up to 10 skills may be loaded at a time, new inputs past that will overwrite the oldest skill

Double click a skill to edit that skill  
Clear emptys the main input box  
Clear All will delete the entire log  
Skill direction must be specified by B or F, otherwise Back flipping bonus will not be applied  
Auto Detect F/B auto applies Back Flip Bonus for all skills not ending in half turn

I forgot to add functionality to delete a individual skill from log. later. probably
